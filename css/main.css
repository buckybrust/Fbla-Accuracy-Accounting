/*  Notes on Responsive Design*/
/*  1.Nav bar right white, margin between the two right triangles, and the margin between the logo and navbar shrinks responsively without media quieries
    2.carrousel after final shrinking will gain height if the text in even one of the scrolling images is too big.
    3.nav button on smaller screens loses the green line animation for simplicity
    4.Most the page starts either 2 or 3 column but shrinks to 1 column
    5.The Testimonials Text size never changes
